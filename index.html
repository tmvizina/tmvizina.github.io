    <h2> What have I been up to? </h2>

    <p> 
        2021 has been a big year of change for me personally. I started the year weighing in at 240lbs and hating what I did for a living. So I called my brother on New Years Day and bet him several hundred dollars that I could lose more weight than he could before our birthdays in August. Today six months later I'm down 54lbs, 99 pounds overall  I've done more than just lose weight. The momentum I've gained from losing weight inspired me to improve all the aspects of my life I was unhappy with. I finally quit the souldraining job and enrolled at Grand Circus to pursue a career as a full stack developer. Learning new things and stimulating my mind has greatly increased the satisfaction I have with my life.

        Before attending Grand Circus my only experience with writing code was MATLAB, which is a function orientated language aimed more at engineering than general use. Grand Circus started out with C# an object oriented language thats so much more flexible its almost a breath of fresh air haha. We had spent the first few weeks exclusively covering CSharp but the course has expanded beyond just the basics of C# to include the following:

    <ul>
        <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
        <li>FileIO</li>
        <li>Test Driven Development</li>

    <p>Indian River is a small uincorportated village in cheboygan county. My family moved here from Canada to cut trees here in the 1880's and most of us have been here ever since. Its a picturesque community right in the middle of a chain of lakes known as the Inland Waterway. Its a very popular recreation destination in the summer for the lakes and a great getaway for snowmobiling during the winter months. I've linked a short song written by our township supervisor that shows off a little of the town. </p>
